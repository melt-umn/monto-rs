# Getting Started with Monto3

## Installing everything

### Getting a client

Right now, there are two clients, the command-line client and the Atom plugin.
The Atom plugin is recommended unless you're hacking on the protocol itself.

#### Getting the Atom Plugin

Check [here](https://github.umn.edu/melt/monto-atom#installing).

#### Getting the CLI client

The CLI client is included in this repo; it should get installed as `monto-simple-client` if installing all binaries.
Running `cargo install` when inside this repo should install it to `~/.cargo/bin`.

### Getting the Broker

The broker's in this repo; `cargo install` should install it to `~/.cargo/bin` as `monto-broker`.

### Getting services

There are a few services floating around:

 - [`monto-example-services`](https://github.com/melt-umn/monto-example-services) includes a few demo services for plain text.
 - TODO
